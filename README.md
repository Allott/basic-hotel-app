Small tech task
- Sort the results by hotel name/star/price and highlight when active
- Ability to toggle expanded hotel description

Todo / Things to improve:
- Spec asked for JS, but could have reasonably done tsx
- No prettier or code formatting outside of base eslint
- Enough tests for a tech task but missing some coverage
- Provided some responsive design, some tablet views im not super happy with but out of spec
- Part of above it trying out next image component, need more practice with it
- Probably needs an accessibility pass, lighthouse seems to think its ok
- Think buttons could be split out into separate components but we get into component library territory then

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
